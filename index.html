                <p>Renewable energy assets have become a significant worldwide asset class as a result of substantial deployment of wind and solar installations in the past ten years. Wind energy deployments have more than doubled in the world over the past five years to 318,000 MW. The worldwide photovoltaic capacity reached 136,000 MW by the end of 2013 representing a 35% increase. There is now sufficient solar deployment to generate 1% of the electricity demand on the planet. The rapid deployment is, in part, due to wind and solar technologies continuing to reduce costs of production and becoming competitive with other fuel sources without government subsidies. Wind energy projects have experienced reduced costs in the order of 75% during the past 30 years due to production cost decreases and capacity factor increases. Similarly, solar panel costs have dropped by 90% in the past ten years. </p>
                <p> JRC was created in 2014 to source and acquire attractive investment opportunities in renewable energy projects in the Americas. These opportunities may be development projects or operating projects with a different risk profiles and return expectations. The projects will be acquired for JRC's own account or on behalf of third-party investors. These assets are attractive investments as they have no fuel costs, are generally contracted with investment graded utilities and have minimal ongoing staffing needs relative to the size of the original investment. </p>
                <p>JRC uses a very experienced team to analyze the various renewable energy investment opportunities. Each team member has more than 15 years of energy related experience and a vast network of contacts within the renewable energy industry from which to draw additional support. The team is augmented by various consultants and brokers who are currently marketing investment opportunities. See management team description for further details.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wind energy assets operating throughout the world have more than doubled in the past five years.</strong></p>
                    <p>The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) released its 2013 market statistics today, with cumulative global capacity reaching a total of 318,137 MW, an increase of nearly 200,000 MW in the past five years. However, the annual market dropped by almost 10 GW to 35,467 MW, attributable to the precipitous drop in US installations due to the policy gap created by the US Congress in 2012. While 2013 marked another difficult year for the industry with 'only' 12.5% cumulative growth, the prospects for 2014 and beyond look much brighter.</p>
